**Abstract**:\
In distributed systems like etcd, read index latency impacts the speed and efficiency of strongly consistent read operations. Etcdâ€™s read index ensures linearizability by coordinating between follower and leader nodes, but this process introduces increased latency as cluster size grows. Higher latency can hinder performance in applications requiring fast, frequent reads. This paper proposes a lease-based approach to reduce read index latency while maintaining consistency. The method aims to balance responsiveness and data accuracy in large-scale etcd deployments.
